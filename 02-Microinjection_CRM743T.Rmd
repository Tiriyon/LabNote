## Microinjections on November 13^th^:

*Date: November 13^th^, 2019*
Following protocol <!-- \hyperlink{protocol1}{{\color{purple}{\underline{number 1}}}}. -->

We got our \textcolor{blue}{first batch} which I now call \hypertarget{Batch number 1}{"Batch number 1"}.

### Batch table:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tibble)
library(kableExtra)
batch.file<-tribble(
  ~Batch, ~Parents, ~`Date`, ~`Number of offsprings`, ~`Number of living offsprings`,
  "Batch 1", "TL find out which cell" ,"Nov 13 2019", 40 , 18
)
kable(batch.file, "latex", booktabs = TRUE)
```

Batch 1 compiles of 40 zygotes, 27 of which were microinjected by Hagai, 13 of which were injected by me.
See [\textcolor{purple}{my plate}](images/batch1TL_M743T_MI_Tom_nov_13_2019.jpg), or [\textcolor{purple}{Hagai's plate}](images/batch1TL_M743T_MI_hagai_nov_13_2019.jpg)

Due to distance between our lab and lab 3 where the microinjections took place, along with unawareness of lack of devices such as 10 ÂµL pipettes, we performed the injections on 8-16 cell stage zygotes (Hagai and I).

In my case some of the microinjections did not enter the cell, most were inside the egg close to the cell.

*Date: December 10^th^, 2019*
After conducting Microinjections on November 13^th^, I have data about \textcolor{brownyellow}{larvae's survivability after injection}. Part of the experiment's objectives was to examine my skills vs Hagai's skills.
