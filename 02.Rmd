## Frankenbodies colony seeding

### 27Jun2020 Seeded bacteria containing Frankenbody plasmids (FB)

On LB agar plates for isolation (isolation seeding).  
On this day I used Ampicillin for all FBs, which was incorrect since only FB: gfpx6His had AmpR gene.  

ToDo: 
1. list original plasmid names
2. Enter 28June2020 folder and paste link to Inventory ODS file.
3. Write down the protocol for isolation seeding.
4. include glycerol 50% preparation.

## 27July2020 Frankenbodies plasmid arrival, streaking cultures

## 27July2020 Colony streaking of arrived frankenbody plasmids colonies

Following the protocol...

### Day 1 27July2020 

I prepared the biological hood at the second floor large chemistry laboratory.
Taken an ampicilin work solution from preparation room and diluted by 0.175.
After which I smeared 7 LB agar plates with 200 µl diluted ampicilin with beads:  
2 for FBmCh, 2 for FBgfp, 2 for FBgfp6xHis and 1 for control, had another plate with nothing on it for negative control as well, total 7 plates.
I touched the center of the Frankenbodies initial agar tube at the center of its poke hole and streaked the corresponding plates. My smearing was a bit rough and I scarred the agar.
Finally I placed the used blue sticks inside a 5 ml liquid LB and incubated the plates and liquid broth at 37°C overnight.

### Day 2 28July2020

The plates did provide colony isolation for FBgfp6xHis, although none grew on FBmCh or FBgfp. The reason why, is that I used ampicilin although the plasmids only had kanamycin resistance. Negative control showed no growth. The FBgfp underwent isolated colony liquid broth culturing overnight. The FBgfp6xHis liquid broth from the day before was glycerol stocked at -80°C fridge at the preparation room of the second floor ([See inventory file from 28 July](tables/inventory.ods)).

New cultures for FBgfp and FBmCh were prepared using kanamycin, 2 plates each incubated overnight.

### Day 3 29July2020

FBgfp and FBmCh isolation plates showed single colonies which were then transferred to liquid broth overnight.

Plasmid isolation for FBgfp6xHis was performed according to manufacturer protocol (promega - Wizard Plus SV minipreps DNA purification system - A1330).


### Day 4 30July2020

FBgfp and FBmCh isolated colonies were glycerol stocked ([See inventory file from 28 July](tables/30july2020_inventory.ods)).
I used the delivered FB agar tubes for new MIX colony liquid growth overnight to preserve the FB state as close to ordered. By MIX I mean I swabbed the blue stabby thing inside the tubes and ripped the agar apart and then dumped the blue stabby thingy in a liquid LB broth overnight.
 
Plasmid isolation for FBgfp and FBmCh was performed according to manufacturer protocol (promega - Wizard Plus SV minipreps DNA purification system - A1330).
I also performed second elution for each, using 20µl nuclease free water. [Results are shown for all plasmids in linked file](tables/Nanodrop_plasmid_elution_results.ods).

### Day 5 31July2020

Glycerol stocked the mix cultures, see inventory file.

[For final inventory outlook check this file](tables/30july2020_inventory.ods).

### T7 Splicing: FBgfp CMV T7 insertion

**Goal:** Insert T7 promotor inside the CMV promotor so that I can T7 IVT the plasmid into mRNA for microinjections.

**The design is as follows:**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vBbS6Vj.png?1)

[see local](images/T7InsertionDesign.png)

The two enzymes I cut with are BglII and HindIII which are one-cutters. The T7 promotor was designed with an extra g for better transcription performance, and ordered with 5' phosphorylation.

----------------------------------

**The layout of this experiment is as follows:**

* run cut  
* clen  
* run clean  
* anneal  
* ligate  
* transform  


----------------------------------

#### run cut

run gel 1.5% agaros for cut   product fb gfp  
0.45 g agarose 30ml tbe 1.5   microliter gelred x20K  

**Seems like I took the wrong tube - tube number 004 contains the second lower elution - 96.91**  
Nope, that was the first ilute, fix nanodrop and inventory files!  

##### on strip:

2. gfp1 12 +2buff cut  
3. gfp2 10+2buff cut  
4. gfp2 2nd elut uncut 5.5+2buff  


gel size is 6.5 X 10.2 cm  

##### result

----------------------------------

#### clean

I have taken 12 microliters from each cut plasmid, starting at 240 now my volume is 228 microliters.

Following protocol...

----------------------------------

#### run clean


----------------------------------

#### anneal

**suspended T7 oligos:**

R + 209 µl DDW  
F + 254 µl DDW  

##### Annealing buffer:

400 µl Tris 1M @ pH 8
200 µl MgCl~2~ (which concentration?)
100 µl NaCl 5M
20 µl EDTA 0.5 M @ pH 8
280 µl DDW

[From researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_annealing_buffer_recipe_to_anneal_two_oligos_to_create_an_adaptor)

>"I usually anneal in 1x NEB restriction enzyme buffer 4.  The reaction contains 2ul of each oligo (1ug/ul), 5ul 10x NEB buffer 4 and 41ul H2O (50ul total volume).  Incubate at 98oC for 5mins in a PCR block and then remove and allow to cool slowly to room temperature.
Dilute the annealed oligo's 1 in 250 in dH2O and use 1ul of this to ligate 100ng of plasmid in a 20ul rxn volume, overnight at 16oC. I then use 2ul to transform competent cells. I do this routinely and it always works. I never really worry to much about the insert vector ratios unless the oligos have compatible cohesive ends and can for concatamers.
I hope this helps. Good luck with your research."

By the above I made a 2nd rxn with NEBbuffer 4.

>"We anneal primers at 10µM each in nuclease free water, then let them anneal without any other buffer added. We heat the samples to 95°C for 5 min, then decrease the temperature by 1 degree every second until we reach 12°C.
We then dilute the annealed primers 1/1000 and use 1.5µl of this with 150ng of digested and dephosphorylated vecor in a 10µl TAKARA DNA ligation reaction (Clontech)and incubate 30 min at 16°C. We use 2-3µl of the reaction for bacterial transformations"

Totalling: 
1. My buffer 5 µl + 1 µl each oligo + 43 µl DDW (50µl total): oligo ng = 
2. ntc (buffer + DDW, 50 µl)
3. NEBbuffer 5µl + 2µl each oligo + 41µl DDW (50µl total)


----------------------------------

#### Ligation

Hagai took 50 ng/µl of the cut plasmid to the ligation rxn.
from the insert he took .5 microliter of 1X stock inside 50 µl annealing rxn which is 2 micromol.

**[By protocol from promega](https://worldwide.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/protocols/product-information-sheets/g/t4-dna-ligase-blue-white-cloning-qualified-protocol.pdf?la=en):**

[link to local](documents/T4 DNA Ligase Blue_White Cloning Qualified 9PIM180.pdf)

$\text{insert mass (ng)}=\text{ng of vector} * \frac{\text{kb size of insert}} {\text{kb size of vector}}*\text{molar ratio of }\frac{\text{insert}}{\text{vector}}$

To go for $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{10}$ ratios I need:

**Dilute clean cut plasmid:**

**[X01] 20µl(92 ng/µl) + 16.8 µl DDW = 50 ng/µl**

**[X02] 25µl(86 ng/µl) + 18 µl DDW = 50 ng/µl**

**1:10**

$\text{2.525 (ng)} \approx 2.5 nl =\text{50 ng} * \frac{\text{0.028 kb}} {\text{5.545 kb}}*\frac{\text{10}}{\text{1}}$

Hence need to dilute MyBuff solution:

**1µl stock + 11.8 µl DDW to reach 2.5 ng µl^-1^**

Hence need to dilute NEBuff solution:

**1µl stock + 27.8 µl DDW to reach 2.5 ng µl^-1^**

**1:3**

$\text{0.757 (ng)} \approx 1 ng =\text{50 ng} * \frac{\text{0.028 kb}} {\text{5.545 kb}}*\frac{\text{3}}{\text{1}}$

Hence need to dilute MyBuff solution:

**1µl stock + 31 µl DDW to reach 1 ng µl^-1^**

Hence need to dilute NEBuff solution:

**1µl stock + 71 µl DDW to reach 1 ng µl^-1^**

##### ligation rxns (strip)

The above strip is going through SpinVac for 1 h at 60°C after-which I will resuspend the digestion products in 10 µL.

Additionally I am making a 5th reaction (call it 4th if you dissregard the failed AflIII reaction , AflII is needed instead) for FBgfp with no T7, I should start adding the T7 in the naming, So FBgfpCMV plasmid with XhoI to see if the enzyme actually cut.

### 09Sep2020 New Digestions: 


I figured out that the T7 insert deletes the HindIII RE site on the FBgfp (and other FB plasmids). I can use that to perform the negative digestion assay.

## 13Sep2020 FBgfp After T7 splicing, gel analysis

37°C for all reactions.

Digest with XhoI again, gel run w/o speedVac!
