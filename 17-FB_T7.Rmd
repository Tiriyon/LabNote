# T7 Splicing: FBgfp CMV T7 insertion

**Goal:** Insert T7 promotor inside the CMV promotor so that I can T7 IVT the plasmid into mRNA for microinjections.

**The design is as follows:**

[see local](images/T7InsertionDesign.png)

The two enzymes I cut with are BglII and HindIII which are one-cutters. The T7 promotor was designed with an extra g for better transcription performance, and ordered with 5' phosphorylation.

----------------------------------

**The layout of this experiment is as follows:**

* run cut  
* clen  
* run clean  
* anneal  
* ligate  
* transform  


----------------------------------

## run cut

run gel 1.5% agaros for cut   product fb gfp  
0.45 g agarose 30ml tbe 1.5   microliter gelred x20K  

**Seems like I took the wrong tube - tube number 004 contains the second lower elution - 96.91**  
Nope, that was the first ilute, fix nanodrop and inventory files!  

### on strip:

2. gfp1 12 +2buff cut  
3. gfp2 10+2buff cut  
4. gfp2 2nd elut uncut 5.5+2buff  


gel size is 6.5 X 10.2 cm

----------------------------------

## clean

I have taken 12 microliters from each cut plasmid, starting at 240 now my volume is 228 microliters.

Following protocol... 


tubes: 
X01 FBgfp1
X02 FBgfp2
X01.1 FBgfp1 2nd ilution
X02.2 FBgfp2 2nd ilution

## run clean


----------------------------------

## anneal

**suspended T7 oligos:**

R + 209 µl DDW  
F + 254 µl DDW  

### Annealing buffer:

400 µl Tris 1M @ pH 8
200 µl MgCl~2~ (which concentration?)
100 µl NaCl 5M
20 µl EDTA 0.5 M @ pH 8
280 µl DDW

[From researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_annealing_buffer_recipe_to_anneal_two_oligos_to_create_an_adaptor)

>"I usually anneal in 1x NEB restriction enzyme buffer 4.  The reaction contains 2ul of each oligo (1ug/ul), 5ul 10x NEB buffer 4 and 41ul H2O (50ul total volume).  Incubate at 98oC for 5mins in a PCR block and then remove and allow to cool slowly to room temperature.
Dilute the annealed oligo's 1 in 250 in dH2O and use 1ul of this to ligate 100ng of plasmid in a 20ul rxn volume, overnight at 16oC. I then use 2ul to transform competent cells. I do this routinely and it always works. I never really worry to much about the insert vector ratios unless the oligos have compatible cohesive ends and can for concatamers.
I hope this helps. Good luck with your research."

By the above I made a 2nd rxn with NEBbuffer 4.

>"We anneal primers at 10µM each in nuclease free water, then let them anneal without any other buffer added. We heat the samples to 95°C for 5 min, then decrease the temperature by 1 degree every second until we reach 12°C.
We then dilute the annealed primers 1/1000 and use 1.5µl of this with 150ng of digested and dephosphorylated vecor in a 10µl TAKARA DNA ligation reaction (Clontech)and incubate 30 min at 16°C. We use 2-3µl of the reaction for bacterial transformations"

Totalling: 
1. My buffer 5 µl + 1 µl each oligo + 43 µl DDW (50µl total): oligo ng = 
2. ntc (buffer + DDW, 50 µl)
3. NEBbuffer 5µl + 2µl each oligo + 41µl DDW (50µl total)


----------------------------------

## Ligation

Hagai took 50 ng/µl of the cut plasmid to the ligation rxn.
from the insert he took .5 microliter of 1X stock inside 50 µl annealing rxn which is 2 micromol.

**[By protocol from promega](https://worldwide.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/protocols/product-information-sheets/g/t4-dna-ligase-blue-white-cloning-qualified-protocol.pdf?la=en):**

[link to local](documents/T4 DNA Ligase Blue_White Cloning Qualified 9PIM180.pdf)

$\text{insert mass (ng)}=\text{ng of vector} * \frac{\text{kb size of insert}} {\text{kb size of vector}}*\text{molar ratio of }\frac{\text{insert}}{\text{vector}}$

To go for $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{10}$ ratios I need:

**Dilute clean cut plasmid:**

**[X01] 20µl(92 ng/µl) + 16.8 µl DDW = 50 ng/µl**

**[X02] 25µl(86 ng/µl) + 18 µl DDW = 50 ng/µl**

**1:10**

$\text{2.525 (ng)} \approx 2.5 nl =\text{50 ng} * \frac{\text{0.028 kb}} {\text{5.545 kb}}*\frac{\text{10}}{\text{1}}$

Hence need to dilute MyBuff solution:

**1µl stock + 11.8 µl DDW to reach 2.5 ng µl^-1^**

Hence need to dilute NEBuff solution:

**1µl stock + 27.8 µl DDW to reach 2.5 ng µl^-1^**

**1:3**

$\text{0.757 (ng)} \approx 1 ng =\text{50 ng} * \frac{\text{0.028 kb}} {\text{5.545 kb}}*\frac{\text{3}}{\text{1}}$

Hence need to dilute MyBuff solution:

**1µl stock + 31 µl DDW to reach 1 ng µl^-1^**

Hence need to dilute NEBuff solution:

**1µl stock + 71 µl DDW to reach 1 ng µl^-1^**

### ligation rxns (strip)

**1. FBgfp1 + MyBuf + X10**  
**2. FBgfp1 +NEB + X10**  
**3. FBgfp2 + MyBuf + X10** 
**4. control + MyBuf + X10**  
**5. FBgfp1 + MyBuf + X3**
**6. FBgfp1 +NEB + X3**
**7. FBgfp2 + MyBuf + X3**
