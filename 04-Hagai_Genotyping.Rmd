## March 5^th^ 2020 - PCR 

By Hagai's decree we are hereby complled to follow through rigorous polymerase chain reaction for 16 fin clip details of different zebra fishes that now lie within the incubator inside small containers numbered A5#1-A5#12. 

The ZF details are from A5 cell in the old large system, they were spawned at April 24^th^ 2019 to parents in cell E3 (old large system). The parents are "male AB tg mut" with "female AB +/-".

**ZF Detail FC sampling**

Material <- c("DNA", "pF",
             "pR", "F1.2", "GoTaq",
             "DDW", "final volume")
Unit<- c("µl","µl","µl","µl","µl","µl","µl")
X1<- c(2,1,1,1,12.5,7.5,25)
X18<-X1*18

df<-data.frame(Material,Unit,X1,X18)

  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")

**Results:**



![Gel Electroporesis Results For A5 details PCR for exon 13](images/A5Genotyping4Mar2020.png)
1.5% agarose gel, 110V for 40 min.

Second row ran outside of gel, no negative control or positive control. Samples are noted as A5#<sample number>, Negative control noted as NC, Positive control noted as PC. Samples A5#1, #2, #3, #6, #8, #10 and #11 show 2 bands (200 & 300 bp). Samples A5#4, #5, #7, #9 and #12 show a single band (300bp).

**Notes:**

Hagai’s primers were left at Nataly’s and Bar’s box - [see image](../images/hagaisprimerslocation4mar2020.jpg).

For future reference: can we throw these? (pile of DNA extract tubes from A5 large system spawn) - [see image](images/pileoftubes4mar2020.jpg)

KO DNA sample left on yellow plate inside fume hood (right bottom corner).

**March 5^th^ 2020 - Samples B-5 to B-8 repeat.**

*Hypothesis:* Either something blocks the PCR, be it excess DNA or lack of DNA. 

We try high dilution and high concentration of the prior DNA extract samples.

**Instructions:**

1. Prepare reaction mixes A and B as follows.
2. Dilute extracted DNA for injected details (Strip B, 6-8) to $\frac{1}{40}$ as described in Strip A table.
3. Prepare PCR as follows in Stip Z and F tables.

### Mix A:
