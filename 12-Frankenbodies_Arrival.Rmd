# Learned total RNA extraction from Hagai 
ToDo: copy protocol

# Frankenbodies arrival

ToDo:

1. Move colonies to liquid media.
2. Scan order details


## Frankenbodies plasmids:

I recieved plasmids for gfp, mCherry and gfp+6his in the form of colony stab. 

## Frankenbodies colony seeding

# Seeded bacteria containing Frankenbody plasmids (FB)

On LB agar plates for isolation (isolation seeding).  
On this day I used Ampicillin for all FBs, which was incorrect since only FB: gfpx6His had AmpR gene.  

ToDo: 
1. list original plasmid names
2. Enter 28June2020 folder and paste link to Inventory ODS file.
3. Write down the protocol for isolation seeding.
4. include glycerol 50% preparation.
