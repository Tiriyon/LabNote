# 10June2020 Fin clips, 19-20 May 2020 - Lab procedure and results

## PCR preparation:

* Made a working stock for `ex12_345R` reverse primer for exon 12 amplification.
* 10 $\mu M$ from $10 \mu l$ of $100 \mu M$ stock and $90 \mu l$ DDW.
* I will PCR only strips: A-D + Z.
* A-D PCR by WTS only (need to perform F1_2 for heterozygotes screening).
* Strips A-D + Z were boiled at $95 $ for 10 minutes.
* Mixes for ex12 and WTS amplifications were prepared according to 9June2020 preparation tables.
* DNA extract were dilute 1/40 from stock.
* DNA for Z was taken from a 1/10 dilution. 

## PCR strip 

A: A1-A8
B: B1-B5, 6=NTC, B7-B8
C: C1-C8
D: D1-D7
Z: Z1-Z3, Z6-Z8, 7=NTC, 8=-

```

**Strips D,Z**

```{r, Gel2, out.width = "300 pt"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../365/10June2020/Master 2020-06-10_15h45m46s.png")
```

Both gels: 1.5%, 120V @ 28min. 

## Stored:

* PCR amplicons inside Molecular lab (big) at $-20 \degree$ fridge.
* DNA extracts in our lab's fridge.

## Follow up:

* Analyze results.
* Repair PCR for strip Z, send to sequence. 
* PCR strip Y.
* PCR A-D+Y, F1_2.
* Move Fish accordingly.
* Repair latex code for tables 9June2020....
