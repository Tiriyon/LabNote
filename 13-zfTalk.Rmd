Today I mostly studies for an exam.  After thought, I would like to start grafting the plasmids I need. Inquiring Hagai revealed that there should be some plasmids containing both hGNE and zfGNE somewhere in our lab. Thus, I can start looking at pc maps and look for RE and methods for inserting mutations.  

**To-Do:**  
* Physically find plasmid tubes.  
* Locate pc maps.  
* Dig through methods.
