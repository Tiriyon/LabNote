DNA level: As I came up with some issues with my injections, you suggested me to make some adjustments to my injection mix from HD template concentration to injection volume adjustment. Furthermore, I will look into more options for using enhancer and inhibitor materials including the ones in our lab. Protein level: I got green light on the frankenbodies (FB), and as we discussed the immediate phase is to check FB’s activity in zebrafish (ZF) with a “dud” protein from Avi’s HA tagged protein plasmid. To do so I will have to inoculate the plasmid in e-coli, T7 transcribe it in-vitro and finally inject both FB mRNA and Avi’s HA tagged protein. The end result is specific illumination of the HA tagged plasmid. After that we can go shenanigans and construct different GNE mutant HA tagged protein plasmids, then onwards to inject KO ZF. ZF KO rescue: First thing needed to be examined is if hGNEwt can actually rescue KO ZF. I need to either acquire hGNEwt containing plasmid or construct one. After acquisition of hGNEwt will inject KO ZF and proceed to examine deadtf-deadti between KO injected and KO un-injected. If KO injected with hGNEwt we can conclude that hGNE can rescue and thus we can use it to perform recombinant protein injections. FB highlight: The highlight of the frankenbodies will be finally verified one we can visualize the protein in gel or western using fluorescent assay. (IF) After which we can proceed to examine PTM on the protein. Furthermore, we can see, in-vivo if the protein aggregates in tissues. Lastly, after fluorescence is achieved in-vivo using FB, we can examine how long the proteins last in the tissue, if mutations cause change in λ of the protein; if epimerase mutations rescue and if only epimerase part of the GNE can rescue.

For this, we harvested U2OS cells expressing HA-tagged H2B or β-actin. In contrast to the parental 12CA5 anti-HA antibody, which we had to stain with a secondary antibody, we could detect the frankenbody in blots using the GFP signal alone. Similar bands were seen in both cases (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although several of the bands were dimmer than those using the antibody, we attributed the difference to signal amplification from the secondary antibody. Together, our Western blot and immunostaining results demonstrate the HA frankenbody can serve as a cost-effective replacement for the anti-HA antibody in widely used in vitro applications.” - Zhao 2019 Fig. 3 Also: “MCP-HaloTag was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography.

Taken an ampicilin work solution from preparation room and diluted by 0.175. After which I smeared 7 LB agar plates with 200 µl diluted ampicilin with beads: 2 for FBmCh, 2 for FBgfp, 2 for FBgfp6xHis and 1 for control, had another plate with nothing on it for negative control as well, total 7 plates. I touched the center of the Frankenbodies initial agar tube at the center of its poke hole and streaked the corresponding plates. My smearing was a bit rough and I scarred the agar. Finally I placed the used blue sticks inside a 5 ml liquid LB and incubated the plates and liquid broth at 37°C overnight. 13.2 Day 2 28July2020 The plates did provide colony isolation for FBgfp6xHis, although none grew on FBmCh or FBgfp. The reason why, is that I used ampicilin although the plasmids only had kanamycin resistance. Negative control showed no growth. The FBgfp underwent isolated colony liquid broth culturing overnight. The FBgfp6xHis liquid broth from the day before was glycerol stocked at -80°C fridge at the preparation room of the second floor (See inventory file from 28 July). New cultures for FBgfp and FBmCh were prepared using kanamycin, 2 plates each incubated overnight. 13.3 Day 3 29July2020 FBgfp and FBmCh isolation plates showed single colonies which were then transferred to liquid broth overnight. Plasmid isolation for FBgfp6xHis was performed according to manufacturer protocol (promega - Wizard Plus SV minipreps DNA purification system - A1330). 13.4 Day 4 30July2020 FBgfp and FBmCh isolated colonies were glycerol stocked (See inventory file from 28 July). I used the delivered FB agar tubes for new MIX colony liquid growth overnight to preserve the FB state as close to ordered. By MIX I mean I swabbed the blue stabby thing inside the tubes and ripped the agar apart and then dumped the blue stabby thingy in a liquid LB broth overnight. Plasmid isolation for FBgfp and FBmCh was performed according to manufacturer protocol (promega - Wizard Plus SV minipreps DNA purification system - A1330).

The reaction contains 2ul of each oligo (1ug/ul), 5ul 10x NEB buffer 4 and 41ul H2O (50ul total volume). Incubate at 98oC for 5mins in a PCR block and then remove and allow to cool slowly to room temperature. Dilute the annealed oligo’s 1 in 250 in dH2O and use 1ul of this to ligate 100ng of plasmid in a 20ul rxn volume, overnight at 16oC. I then use 2ul to transform competent cells. I do this routinely and it always works. I never really worry to much about the insert vector ratios unless the oligos have compatible cohesive ends and can for concatamers. I hope this helps. Good luck with your research.” By the above I made a 2nd rxn with NEBbuffer 4. “We anneal primers at 10µM each in nuclease free water, then let them anneal without any other buffer added. We heat the samples to 95°C for 5 min, then decrease the temperature by 1 degree every second until we reach 12°C. We then dilute the annealed primers 1/1000 and use 1.5µl of this with 150ng of digested and dephosphorylated vecor in a 10µl TAKARA DNA ligation reaction (Clontech)and incubate 30 min at 16°C.
